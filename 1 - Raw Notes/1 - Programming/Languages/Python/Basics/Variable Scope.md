### Includes:

variable scope, scope resolution.

## 1. Variable scope:

Where a variable is visible and accessible

  

## 2. Scope resolution:

(LEGB) Local → Enclosed → Global → Built-in

Kind of a variable hierarchy system.

First python will check for a variable in local scope then enclosed then global at last built-in.

whatever variable is coming first will be given priority.
